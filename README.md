# Look-Up_Table
This reports presents the design and analysis of a 4-bit Look-Up Table (LUT) using the Cadence Virtuoso tool for digital circuit applications. The LUT is a fundamental component in FieldProgrammable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), enabling flexible implementation of logic functions. In this design, the 4-bit LUT is implemented at the transistor level using 90nm CMOS technology. The schematic design process involves the creation of memory cells(D flipflop) and multiplexers to realize the LUT's functionality. The primary focus of this work includes power and delay optimization for the 4-bit LUT.
