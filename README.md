# Look-Up_Table
🔧 Project Title:
Design and Analysis of 4-bit Look-Up Table (LUT) in 90nm CMOS Technology

📍Description:
Designed and implemented a 4-bit LUT at the transistor level using 90nm CMOS technology in Cadence Virtuoso. The LUT, built using D Flip-Flops, multiplexers, and basic logic gates, was configured to store and retrieve precomputed logic values for all 4-bit input combinations. This project involved detailed transient simulations, power analysis, and delay measurements under various process corners (TT, FF, SS) to evaluate performance.

📈 Key Outcomes:

Successfully verified LUT functionality for multiple logic functions.
Performed post-layout simulations to assess power consumption and propagation delay.
Gained hands-on experience with custom digital design flow in Cadence Virtuoso.
Served as a reference baseline for comparison with 18nm FinFET-based LUT design.
